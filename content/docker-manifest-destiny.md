I expose myself to no risk when I make the statement that if you are not containerising your app, you are wrong.

Maybe your current architecture doesn't lend itself to containerisation - your current architecture is wrong.
Maybe you are running on platform that doesn't support containers - your platform is now obsolete.
Maybe you're just one developer hacking together something experimental on your own machine - you are only hurting you own productivity.

Just because you *can* write software without using containers, doesn't mean you *should* [article]

Just as we don't have to chose to use processes, it's just how we run work on an OS, there is no longer a need to choose Docker, it's just how we do things now.

Let us take a step back to the Manifest Destiny analogy. When the colonization of North America started, there was this feeling of destiny, that the expansion across the country was _Justified_ and _Inevitable_.

These concepts now applies to containers' sweeping usage. We are justified in their use by containers' almost self-evident superiority. That all systems will use containers in the future is certainly inevitable, it is a revolutionary way of thinking in the same way that the UNIX process model was.  

Software containers have, almost overnight, made traditional piecemeal-deployment processes obsolete in the same way as the physical shipping container did for traditional crater based shipping. 

Container-based solutions will eat everything, and it is right that they should. It is manifest destiny in action.
