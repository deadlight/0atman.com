Title: Blaze: A lightweight literate programing preprocessor

I've been playing with many literate programming tools since this technique of document-first programming came into my life two years ago.

[Literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) (LP), a concept that has been around since at least the 80s, is back in the spotlight since the [Eve](http://witheve.com/) language (released by the eve team headed by Chris Granger of [Light Table](http://lighttable.com) fame) was released to the public in 2015.

While LP's original concept aimed to create a document-first system whereby the building blocks of the actual code could be read (by the human or compiler) in any order (as it is in Eve), the contemporary state of the art is focused on creating the document-first model with existing procedural languages.

There are two main kinds of tool in the modern LP category:

 1. Tools that write beautiful documentation based on comments in source code, such as [Docco](http://ashkenas.com/docco/) and (a personal favourite) [Marginalia](https://github.com/gdeer81/marginalia)
 2. Tools that allow you to execute code-fenced source code within some markup, such as [Literate](https://github.com/zyedidia/Literate), [litpro](https://github.com/jostylr/litpro), and tiny [lit](https://github.com/vijithassar/lit).
 
The first is an evolution of the documentation processors you will be familiar with, no real innovation has happened in this space since [Javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc). (Much though I love [Sphynx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html) et al)

The second category I think is worth exploring.

It is into this backdrop I present [Blaze](https://gist.github.com/0atman/5ea526a3ae26409da50dd7697eb700e8).
