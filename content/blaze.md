Title: Blaze: A lightweight literate programing preprocessor

I've been playing with many literate programming tools since this technique of document-first programming came into my life.

There are two main kinds of tool in this category:

 1. Tools that write beautiful documentation based on comments in source code, such as [Docco](http://ashkenas.com/docco/) and (my favourite) [Marginalia](https://github.com/gdeer81/marginalia)
 2. Tools that allow you to execute code-fenced source code within some markup
 
 The first is an evolution of the documentation processors you will be familiar with, no real innovation has happened in this space since [Javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc). (Much though I love [Sphynx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html) et al)

The second category I think is worth exploring.
