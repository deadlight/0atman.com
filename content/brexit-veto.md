Dear Kate Hoey,

I'm astonished you voted against the amendment today which, as I understand it, it gives you a  legal guarantee of a vote on the final Brexit deal struck with Brussels.

I would be very interested to know why you thought handing more power to the Tories and DUP would be a good idea.

Yours sincerely,
